# Technical-QA-internship-task

This is a "README" file for Technical QA internship task. Personally I used PyCharm (version 2024.2).
The code was written in Python (version 3.8.8).

For PyCharm you need to show the path in where the code is located.
Click on the "Add Configuration..." button.
Press the "+" sign.
Search for python and press on it.
On configuration menu where the "Script path" is located, press the folder button.
Now search for the directory on your computer, where the code is located.
Click on the code file.
Press Apply and OK.
If you want to run the code, press the green triangle button on the top right corner of the editor.

For Visual Studio Code users:
Open the code.
Install the Python package.
To run the code press the white triangle on the top right corner of the editor.

With one click of a button it does all of the tests given. Sometimes the code crashes, because of the assert conditions.
To know further details watch in the terminal.

The code is tested and it does all of the tasks. If you want to see it, just run it a bunch of times and it should work.
